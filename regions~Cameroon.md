## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

The [Republic of Cameroon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon "Cameroon") is divided into ten regions.

In 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, President [Paul Biya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Biya "Paul Biya") signed decrees abolishing "provinces" and replacing them with "regions". Hence, all of the country's ten provinces are now known as regions.

Most of these provinces were designated in the 1960s alongside [Centre-South Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Centre-South_Province&action=edit&redlink=1 "Centre-South Province (page does not exist)") (split into Centre and South in 1983). At the same time, Adamawa and Far North Provinces were split from North Province.
